        "1. Identify Keywords for Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD):\n",
        "Start by identifying keywords or phrases that commonly indicate self-admitted technical debt. These keywords can be derived from literature or based on your understanding of common terms used in code comments, commit messages, and issue descriptions. For example, common keywords may include \"TODO,\" \"FIXME,\" \"refactor,\" \"technical debt,\" \"hack,\" \"workaround,\" etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a Dictionary of SATD Keywords:\n",
        "Build a dictionary or a set of SATD keywords that will serve as the basis for content queries in commit messages, modified file comments, and issue descriptions. This dictionary should include the keywords identified in Step 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Using PyDriller for Commit Analysis:\n",
        "You can use PyDriller to analyze commits from the repository. PyDriller is a Python library for analyzing Git repositories. Install it using pip.\n",
        "Create Python scripts that use PyDriller to iterate through the commits and identify those that contain SATD keywords in their messages. You can filter commits based on these keywords and store them in a Set.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Analyze Modified Files in Commits:\n",
        "For each commit, extract the list of modified files. Open and analyze these files to check for SATD keywords in the code comments within the modified lines. Store the commits with modified files containing SATD in a separate Set.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Retrieve Issues from the Issue Tracker:\n",
        "Utilize an API or libraries like JIRA's REST API to fetch issues from the issue tracker (JIRA in this case). For example, you can use Python's requests library to interact with the JIRA API. Query issues based on project (e.g., CASSANDRA) and extract the content of the Summary, Description, and Comments fields for each issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Analyze Issue Descriptions and Comments:\n",
        "Analyze the content of the Summary, Description, and Comments fields for the presence of SATD keywords. Store the issues that contain these keywords in a Set.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Combine Results:\n",
        "Combine the sets of commits and issues identified with SATD keywords from Steps 3, 4, and 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Display or Save Results:\n",
        "You can choose to display the list of commits and issues with SATD keywords or save this information to a file or a database for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Additional Preprocessing:\n",
        "Depending on the quality of your results, you may need to perform additional preprocessing, such as removing false positives or refining the set of SATD keywords.\n",
